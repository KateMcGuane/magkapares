# Magkapares


Magkapares is the Tagalog (Filipino) equivalent of the word "pairs". This project was inspired by my own learning of the Tagalog language. I wanted to create an interactive learning game based on the memory card game. 
This game will exercise memory and recollection, all the while learning a new language. It is suitable for children and adults alike.
