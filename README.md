# Magkapares


Magkapares is the Tagalog (Filipino) equivalent of the word "pairs". This project was inspired by my own learning of the Tagalog language. I wanted to create an interactive learning game based on the memory card game. 
This game will exercise memory and recollection, all the while learning a new language. It is suitable for children and adults alike. 
The website acts as a stepping stone to learning more about the Phillippines, in a fun way through learning a language.

## Design

The website is designed with the essence of the Tagalog language in mind. It illustrates the colourfulness of the Filipino culture & country. 


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the website illustrates variety and fun through the colour palette. 100s of Thousands were the inspiration for this palette of choice.

This palette reflects the hero image that is features across each webpage. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

This palette has stronger tones to it. It is used primarily for elements such as headings or areas of highlighted interest. This is to illustrate contrast and essential elements of importance.

Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Fredericka The Great

  - This has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, and mirrors the chosen style of favicon.

- Poppins
  - This is a legible font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read.

### Imagery

All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).

### Favicon

The favicon reflects the origins of the game; a memory card game. It is rectangular-shaped, with a black question mark and bright pink background to ensure that it stands out when other tabs are open.
