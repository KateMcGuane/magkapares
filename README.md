# Magkapares


Magkapares is the Tagalog (Filipino) equivalent of the word "pairs". This project was inspired by my own learning of the Tagalog language. I wanted to create an interactive learning game based on the memory card game. 
This game will exercise memory and recollection, all the while learning a new language. It is suitable for children and adults alike. 
The website acts as a stepping stone to learning more about the Phillippines, in a fun way through learning a language.

## Design

The website is designed with the essence of the Tagalog language in mind. It illustrates the colourfulness of the Filipino culture & country. 


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the website was inspired by the tropical and rich colours of the Phillippines. 100s of They can be found in their coastlines, dense forests and colourful fruits. 

This palette reflects the hero image that is features across each webpage. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

This palette has stronger tones to it. It is used primarily for elements such as headings or areas of highlighted interest. This is to illustrate contrast and essential elements of importance.

Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
