# Magkapares
A memory card game.

## Roadmap
How will a user interact with our app:

* For the first card they flip, the countdown timer will start    

        - [ ] Variables needed: countDownNumber, resetButton
        - [ ] Functions needed: handleResetClick 
            - handleResetClick needs to reset countNumber to 0
        - [ ] If user wants to try again/start over, user can press the "reset game" button
            - [ ] timer will go back to 0

* For every card they flip, the 'moves' counter will increase by 1

        - [ ] When the user clicks a card, the number of 'moves on the screen will increase by 1
            - [ ] Variables needed: countNumber
            - [ ] Functions needed: handleAddClick
                 - handleAddClick needs to increase countNumber by 1 for every card clicked
